Machine Learning Prediction and Automated Case Allocation - Code &amp; Input Files 

There are 5 files of code numbered 1-5

Files 1:4 are R files and file 5 is a Python file

In order to run the models, each of these numbered files must be run: 
 - in order
 - from beginning to completion

Please note that the Case Handling Duration prediction model and the Resource Allocation model may take a while to run depending on the computer used

In each of the 5 files of code, it is highlighted at the beginning where the user's file path needs to be input

File 4 will output more csv files to the directory which are used in the Resource Allocator
